<p>A full plugin is not really needed for vim integration. Rather, a simple command and a keystroke binding should be sufficient. We welcome contribution of a full plug-in that adds enhanced capabilities.</p>
<p>The main author of SDT has the following in his <code>.vimrc</code></p>
<pre class="vimscript"><code>-- Simply use a dedicated temporary file to hold the latest
-- analysis by Semantic Diff Tool. Load as necessary.
function! SemanticDiffTool()
    execute &quot;! sdt semantic -d -m &gt; /tmp/sdt&quot;
    execute &quot;e /tmp/sdt&quot;
endfunction</code></pre>
<p>Binding a keystroke is probably useful:</p>
<pre class="vimscript"><code>-- David has a preference for shortcuts beginning with comma.
-- Choose whatever binding matches your way of working.
map ,s :call SemanticDiffTool()&lt;CR&gt; &quot; run sdt semantic to buffer</code></pre>
